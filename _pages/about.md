I received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering from [the University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), UK, in 2020, and my M.Sc. degree in Telecommunications and Internet Technology from [King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/), UK, in 2021. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the [Department of Engineering](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/engineering) at King’s College London. I have served as a reviewer for several prestigious journals, including the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, and IEEE Communications Letters. In 2024, I was honoured with the Best Workshop Paper Award at IEEE WCNC.

My research focuses on emerging 6G applications, such as vehicular networks and eHealth, as well as enabling 6G technologies, including integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), semantic communication (SemCom), computation models, near-field (NF) effects, fluid antennas (FAs), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and MIMO systems.
