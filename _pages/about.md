I received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering from [the University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), UK, in 2020, my M.Sc. degree in Telecommunications and Internet Technology from [King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/), UK, in 2021, and my Ph.D. from the [Department of Engineering](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/engineering), King’s College London, in 2025. I have served as a reviewer for several prestigious journals, including the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking, IEEE Transactions on Communications, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, and IEEE Communications Letters. In 2024, I was honoured with the Best Workshop Paper Award at IEEE WCNC. In October 2025, I joined [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/) as a Research Assistant in Prof. Julie McCann’s group, contributing to the [EPSRC CHEDDAR Hub](https://cheddarhub.org/) on security integrated sensing and communication.



Research Focus
======
My research focuses on emerging 6G applications, such as vehicular networks and eHealth, as well as enabling 6G technologies, including integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), semantic communication (SemCom), computation models, near-field (NF) effects, fluid antennas (FAs), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and MIMO systems.



Experience
======
I served as the student representative in the student-staff liaison committee (SSLC) at the Department of Engineering, King's College London, from 2022 to 2024.
